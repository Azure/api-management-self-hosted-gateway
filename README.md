# Azure API Management Self-Hosted Gateway samples and stuff

## What is Azure API Management Self-Hosted Gateway?

[Self-hosted gateway](https://aka.ms/apim/sputnik/overview) is a feature of [Azure API Management](https://aka.ms/apimrocks). The self-hosted gateway, a containerized version of the API Management gateway component, expands API Management support for hybrid and multi-cloud environments. It allows customers to manage all of their APIs using a single API management solution without compromising security, compliance, or performance. Customers can deploy the self-hosted gateways to the same environments where they host their APIs while continuing to manage them from an associated API Management service in Azure.
